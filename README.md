# The Built World

A site to rate your favorite buildings!

The Built World is a site where you can log your ratings and opinions of the buildings you know and love (or hate). Compare your ratings with others and think critically about how buildings and opinions compare. Many sites list the tallest buildings or press you with subjective and snotty reviews.. at The Built World, you finally have a place to store and rank ~your own~ opinions!

## Instructions
Enter your building name, city, and rating on a scale of 0-100.
